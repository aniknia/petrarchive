## Welcome to PetrArchive 👋

This is an archive of the officially dropped Petr stickers at UCI.

### What are Petrs?

Petrs are a tradition at UCI of making and giving out stickers that resemble the UCI mascot Peter. Originally started by Petr the Anteatr, it has grown to a community of many people who donate their time and money to create and distrubute Petr stickers at sticker drops around campus. You can read more about it [here](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8fx7h9r/entire_text/).

### What is this Project?

There are many many Petr stickers. This project is an atempt to catalog Petrs and give a way to "rank" which stickers people like most. You can see the site [here](https://petrarchive.com).

The main website is stored on my github page (its still public) because Im broke and if I host it on an Org then I have to pay for Vercel...
